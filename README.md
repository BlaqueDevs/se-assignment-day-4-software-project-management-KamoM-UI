# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery ensures deadlines are met, not meeting deadlines can cause multiple problem such as low team morale, burnout and can breed frustration. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by firstly, planning, this would be breaking down a project in small chunks/goals allowing the team to visualise progress. Secondly, make sure the team has a clear definition of the project at hand, this allows there to be no miscommunication and everyone is on the same page. Lastly, effective resource allocation, by allocating resources effectively you allow your team to be efficient, allowing the team to feel in control and motivated.  
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control allows resources to be used efficiently, deadlines be met and ensure the project does not turn into financial chaos. First strategy is outlining the requirements of the project upfront, this allows your team to know the goals and expectations of the project. Regular reviews of expenditure, by doing this you can track the progress of the project and the expenditure patterns in refernce to the budget at hand.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Waterfall is linear and sequential, thinks of the name waterfall, you tackle one problem at a time before you move onto the next. Agile is iterative and incremental, more flexible than the waterfall method as you plan in short cycles and adapt as you go. 

Waterfall: Advantages
1. Detailed plans upfront make it easier to estimate budgets, timelines, and resources—great for fixed-bid projects.
2. Extensive documentation each phase ensures a detailed record, useful for future maintenance or compliance.

Waterfall: Disadvantages
1. Issues discovered late (e.g., during testing) can derail timelines and increase costs.
2. Difficult to accommodate changes once the project begins, leading to potential misalignment with client needs.

Agile: Advantages 
1. Easily adapts to changing requirements, making it ideal for innovative or uncertain projects
2. Continuous testing and iteration reduce bugs and ensure the product evolves to meet user needs.

Agile: Disadvantages
1. Lack of a fixed scope can lead to scope creep, making it hard to estimate time and cost upfront.
2. Clients expecting a set deliverable on a strict budget or timeline may find Agile’s fluidity frustrating.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is More Beneficial:
1. Innovative or Experimental Projects
2. Customer-Facing Software
3. Collaborative Environments
Examples:
Mobile app Development
Game Development

When Waterfall is More Beneficial:
1. Regulated Industries
2. Stable, Well-Defined Projects
Examples:
Government software
Construction  
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
1. Code reviews
2. Manual testing
3. User feedback
4. Bug tracking
It is important to maintain high standards to ensure software meets user standards, software is reliable and cost effective and risk mitigation such as security breaches. 
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
The project scope outlines the boundaries of what the project will deliver—its goals, deliverables, tasks, costs, and timelines—as well as what it won’t include. It’s typically documented in a scope statement or project charter. It sets clear objectives, guides resource allocation, facilitates risk management and allows us to visualise progress. 

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable components or work packages. It breaks the total scope into deliverables and tasks, organized in levels. WBS is important as it improves task assignment, facilitates monitoring and control, supports scheduling. 
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits of a detailed project schedule are firstly and most importantly improved time management as it outlines timelines for each tasks helping deadlines be met. Secondly, Risk Mitigation: a detailed schedule can prevent potential delays. Lastly, Improved Communication: team members share a similiar understanding of the project's expectation and timeline.

Gantt Charts Assist by monitoring progress, you can shade portions of the bars to indicate completion status, visualise timeline, resource assignment, team members can see who is responsible for each task and how long it takes them. 
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to adress the energy crisis in my country. The problems are significant as we all experience and are affected by the energy crisis and my software might be a turing point or a huge assistance in the solution of the energy crisis. 
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem helps in clearly defining the possible solutions of the software and clearly outline the aim/expectations the software aims to tackle or adress.  
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
I would describe my software solution as humanitarian, simply put.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Main features currently are informing users of ways to save and use energy efficiently by outlining possible energy solutions 
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Currently I have not researched my mraket size of my software but it will happen in due time. The growth potential of my software is immense as the energy crisis is seemingly getting worse by the day. 
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
Understanding market trends will allow the development of my software enhancing user enagagement.
